# FTC for Prep

## What is the FIRST Tech Challenge?

FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) is a student-centered activity that focuses on giving students a unique and stimulating experience. Each year, Teams participate in a new Game that requires them to design, build, test, and program autonomous and driver-operated Robots that must perform a series of tasks.

## Skills involved include: 							
* Planning, brainstorming, and creative problem- solving.	
* Research and technical skills.
* Collaboration and Teamwork.
* Appreciation of differences and respect for the ideas and contributions of others


## Why

* Our goal is to open doors for our community, and get others to get involved in innovation, science, and an explorative mindset.
* Create an opportunity for the student body to immerse itself in engineering.

## How

* Inspire others through hands on participation in a robotics project to solve a challenge.
* Give Prep students opportunities to get involved in learning about STEM.
